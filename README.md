## Purpose of Project

This project was created for the WeDeliverTECHâ„¢ company. The purpose of this app is to assist a receptionist in checking staff members in and out, 
logging deliveries, and keeping track of any late employees. 

## Usage

In order to check a staff member in the receptionist must click the staff member row
in the "Reception Management Dashboard Staff" table. After selecting the desired staff member the receptionist must click the "Out" button and enter 
the number of minutes the staff member will be out of the office. Once the staff member has returned the receptionist can select the staff member row, 
then click the "In" button. If the staff member returns later than expected the receptionist will be notified which staff member is late, and when they 
were expected to return to the office. The receptionist can also use the "Schedule Delivery" table to keep track of scheduled deliveries. The receptionist 
must type the vehicle type, driver name, driver surname, driver telephone number, delivery address, and the driver's expected return time. After the 
receptionist has filled in all inputs correctly they can click the "Add" button to add the delivery to the "Delivery Board" table. Once the delivery has
been completed and the driver has returned to the office the receptionist can click and select the driver in the "Delivery Board" table and click the
"Clear" button to remove the delivery from the "Delivery Board" table.
